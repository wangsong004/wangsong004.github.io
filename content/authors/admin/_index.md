I am the Director of R&D and Cofounder at VoxelDance, where I focus primarily on algorithms for geometry processing and implicit modeling. Prior to this, I worked as a Geometry Algorithm Engineer at UnionTech for three years. In 2016, I earned a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

I specialize in geometry processing, focusing on triangle mesh algorithms such as model repair, Boolean operations, shell offsetting, remeshing, simplification, and nesting in 2D, 2.5D, and 3D. I also work on dental model optimization, including crown orientation optimization, RPD bracket direction optimization, and dental labeling algorithm development. Currently, I am exploring implicit modeling and triangle-to-tetrahedral mesh conversion.

If you’re interested in collaboration or exchanging ideas, feel free to reach out! 😃
