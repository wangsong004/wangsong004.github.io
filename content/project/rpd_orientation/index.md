Advanced algorithms enhance the efficiency of flipping RPD frames in data and build preparation.

RPD frame nesting, traditionally a time-consuming task, is now streamlined with the updated dental module in VoxelDance Additive. This update reduces placement time from hours to a few minutes. VDA intelligently classifies RPD frames by analyzing their shapes and marking them with distinct colors. Engineers can easily assign different angles for various RPD frame types, significantly boosting productivity and workflow efficiency.
