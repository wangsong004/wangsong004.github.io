Nesting is a crucial technique in Powder Bed Fusion technologies like Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 3D printing, which enables the production of large builds containing hundreds of items.

Efficient nesting maximizes cost-effectiveness by densely packing parts within a single build, reducing material waste and production time. By optimizing the placement of parts on the printing bed, nesting allows for the highest number of parts per printing volume in a single runâ€”enhancing both efficiency and material savings.
